# CTF TOOLS

## Description
The idea behind this repository is to make scripts that can be modified and used in CTFs to speed up the process. An example is a script that can do inital web recon and generate a big output, instead of having to run multiple small programs where you forget the syntax 90% of the time.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the root directory.
3. You should now be able to use the python scripts.
